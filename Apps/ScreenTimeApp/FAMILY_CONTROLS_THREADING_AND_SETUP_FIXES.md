# ✅ Family Controls Threading & Setup Issues Fixed

## 🔧 **Threading Issue Fixed**

### **Problem Identified:**
```
Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed; make sure to publish values from the main thread (via operators like receive(on:)) on model updates.
```

### **Root Cause:**
`AppDiscoveryService.updateAuthorizationStatus()` was updating the `@Published` property `authorizationStatus` from background threads, causing SwiftUI to throw warnings.

### **Solution Implemented:**
```swift
// Before (Background Thread Issue)
public func updateAuthorizationStatus() {
    authorizationStatus = AuthorizationCenter.shared.authorizationStatus
}

// After (Main Thread Safe)
public func updateAuthorizationStatus() {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.authorizationStatus = AuthorizationCenter.shared.authorizationStatus
    }
}
```

**Key Fixes Applied:**
1. **Main Thread Dispatching**: All `@Published` property updates now use `DispatchQueue.main.async`
2. **Async Context Handling**: Authorization requests use `await MainActor.run` for thread safety
3. **Consistent Threading**: All UI-related state updates are properly dispatched to main thread

@available(iOS 16.0, *)
public func requestAuthorization() async throws {
    try await AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization(for: .individual)
    await MainActor.run {
        updateAuthorizationStatus()
    }
}
```
