3. Configure settings for that specific child
4. Changes are automatically saved

### 3. Managing Preferences

App-wide preferences can be managed through the Preferences tab:

1. Appearance settings (Dark Mode, App Icon)
2. Notification preferences
3. Privacy settings
4. Data management (Export, Import, Reset)

## Testing
